- path is path to input files
- file is the name of input file
- type is event type: activity, cluster, position, stock, transport
- epw is the number of events per window
- algo is an algorithm: sase, hcet, aseq, greta
- graphlets is the number of graphlets a graph to be partitioned into for HCET algorithm
- pred is the predicate selectivity, e.g., 50% means that for each new event, half of connections to its predecessor events hold due to predicates
